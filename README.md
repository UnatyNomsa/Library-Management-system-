# Library Management System

## Description
This project is a relational database designed for managing a library's operations using MySQL. It tracks members, books, authors, and loans. The database enforces data integrity using primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints, and models relationships such as many-to-many (books-authors) and one-to-many (members-loans).
